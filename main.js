/*
In this exercise, you will be defining some functions that perform the individual tasks involved in making pottery. 
Pottery minions that will do all the little things needed to make beautiful pieces of dirt art.

Time to deconstruct the process of making pottery.

Buy a big lump of clay
Use a pottery wheel to turn the clay into a bowl
Put the bowl into a kiln for a bisque firing
Apply glaze to bowl
Put glazed bowl in kiln for final firing
ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° (haha, yeah right)

If it has not, you should log the following message to the console.
**Make sure you bisque fire the pottery before you glaze it.**

Define a function named finalFiring. You need to give it the object that glazePottery produced, 
so it needs a parameter to capture that value and use it. 
It also needs to capture the temperature of the kiln, so it needs two parameters.
The function should perform the task of adding a new property named cracked, 
and its value depend on the value of the temperature parameter. 
If that value is higher than 1200, then the value of the cracked property must be true.
If the value is 1200, or less, the value should be false.
The function should then return the object after the new property was added.
To test the function, make sure you invoke it and pass two arguments. First test if a high temperate cracks the pottery.
